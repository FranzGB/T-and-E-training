# Pseudo-classes

CSS pseudo-classes are keywords that can be added to selectors to style elements that are not in a specific state or are not selected by other selectors. Pseudo-classes allow developers to add styles to elements based on user interactions, such as hovering over or clicking on an element, or based on the state of an element, such as whether it's the first child or last child of its parent.

There are many CSS pseudo-classes available, including :hover, :active, :focus, :checked, :disabled, :nth-child(), and :not(), among others. Each pseudo-class has a specific purpose and can be used to apply different styles to elements in different states.

CSS pseudo-classes can be used in conjunction with other selectors to create more specific and targeted styles. For example, you can use the :hover pseudo-class with the a selector to apply a specific style to links when the user hovers over them.

Overall, CSS pseudo-classes are a powerful tool for adding interactivity and dynamic styling to web pages, and can help developers create engaging user experiences.
