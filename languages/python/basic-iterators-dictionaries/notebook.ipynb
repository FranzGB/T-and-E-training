    "This last example is a good one that rises an error. Let's see what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding \"changed size during iteration\" Error\n",
    "In Python, the \"changed size during iteration\" error occurs when you try to modify the size or structure of a collection (e.g., a dictionary) while you are actively iterating over it using a for loop or iterator. This error arises because the iterator is unaware of the changes you are making to the collection, leading to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Does It Happen?\n",
    "Let's break down why this error occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Iteration Start: You initiate a for loop or iterator to traverse through a collection, such as a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modification Inside the Loop: While iterating, you make changes to the collection, such as adding, deleting, or modifying elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Iterator Unaware of Changes: The iterator is created with the initial size and structure of the collection. It doesn't know about any modifications made during iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Size Mismatch: When you modify the collection, the iterator still expects to iterate over the original number of elements. However, the collection's size has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Runtime Error: The mismatch between the expected and actual size of the collection causes a runtime error, specifically the \"changed size during iteration\" error.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Avoid It\n",
    "To prevent the \"changed size during iteration\" error, follow this strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a List for Modifications: Instead of modifying the collection directly within the loop, create a separate list to store the elements you want to add, delete, or modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Iterate First, Modify Later: Complete the iteration loop without making any changes to the collection. During this phase, identify the elements you want to modify and store them in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify After Iteration: After the iteration is complete, apply the modifications to the collection using the list you created. This ensures that the collection's structure remains consistent during the iteration process.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this strategy, you can avoid the \"changed size during iteration\" error."
