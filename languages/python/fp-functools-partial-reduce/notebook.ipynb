    "The `functools` module is a built-in module in Python that provides several higher-order functions that are useful in functional programming. The module contains functions that can be used to manipulate functions and other callable objects, such as decorators, partial functions, and functions that operate on iterables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the `functools` module is to provide a set of tools that make it easier to write functional-style code in Python. Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions as the primary means of computation. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class objects that can be passed around and manipulated like any other value. This makes it possible to write code that is more modular, reusable, and easier to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `functools` module provides several functions that are commonly used in functional programming, including `partial`, `reduce`, `map`, `filter`, and `zip`. These functions can be used to create new functions from existing ones, apply functions to sequences of values, and combine sequences of values in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the `functools` module is an important tool for Python developers who want to write code in a functional style. By providing a set of higher-order functions that can be used to manipulate functions and other callable objects, the module makes it easier to write code that is modular, reusable, and easier to reason about."
